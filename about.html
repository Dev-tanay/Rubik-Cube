        <h1 class="about_heading">About Rubik's Cubes</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the "About" page for Rubik's Cubes! Here, you'll find comprehensive information about Rubik's Cubes, including their history, basic concepts, solving methods, and more.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">History</h2>
        <p>The Rubik's Cube, invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974, is a 3D combination puzzle that has fascinated millions of people worldwide. Originally called the "Magic Cube," it gained immense popularity after being licensed to the Ideal Toy Corporation in 1980 and rebranded as the "Rubik's Cube."</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Basic Concepts</h2>
        <p>A standard Rubik's Cube consists of six faces, each covered by nine stickers of one of six solid colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. The goal is to solve the cube by rotating the faces until each face is a solid color.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Solving Methods</h2>
        <p class="subtopic">There are several methods for solving Rubik's Cube, including:</p>
        <ul class="subtopic">
        <li>Fridrich Method (CFOP)</li>
        <li>BEGINNER Method</li>
        <li>Roux Method</li>
        <li>ZB Method</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Advanced Techniques</h2>
        <p class="subtopic">Advanced cubers often utilize techniques such as:</p>
        <ul class="subtopic">
        <li>OLL (Orientation of Last Layer)</li>
        <li>PLL (Permutation of Last Layer)</li>
        <li>F2L (First Two Layers)</li>
        <li>X-Cross</li>
        <li>OLLCP (OLL plus Corner Permutation)</li>
        </ul>
