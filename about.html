        <p>Welcome to the "About" page for Rubik's Cubes! Here, you'll find comprehensive information about Rubik's Cubes, including their history, basic concepts, solving methods, and more.</p>

        <!-- Changed heading from h2 to h3 for proper heading hierarchy -->
        <h3 class="subheading">History</h3>
        <p>The Rubik's Cube, invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974, is a 3D combination puzzle that has fascinated millions of people worldwide. Originally called the "Magic Cube," it gained immense popularity after being licensed to the Ideal Toy Corporation in 1980 and rebranded as the "Rubik's Cube."</p>

        <!-- Changed heading from h2 to h3 for proper heading hierarchy -->
        <h3 class="subheading">Basic Concepts</h3>
        <p>A standard Rubik's Cube consists of six faces, each covered by nine stickers of one of six solid colors: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. The goal is to solve the cube by rotating the faces until each face is a solid color.</p>
