<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>This is a simple and elegant game where you can play Rubik's Cube from your own web browser.</p>
<p>Each of the six faces of the Rubik's cube is in one of the six colors - red, green, yellow, blue, white, and orange.<p>
<p>The visible part of the cube is divided into 26 pieces - 6 central pieces (only one colored side), 12 edge pieces (two colored sides), and 8 corner pieces (three colored sides).</p>
<p>The 26 pieces are "scrambled" to have different colors on each face.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The objective of this game is to get each face of the cube to have a single color.</p>
<p>This can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Twisting the segments</li>
<p>This can be done by dragging the cursor over the segment you want to rotate.</p>
