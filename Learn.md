# Learn to Build a Rubik's Cube Solver

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube project! In this guide, you'll learn step-by-step how to build your own Rubik's Cube solver using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Project:**
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Inside the directory, create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - Open `index.html` in your code editor.
   - Define the basic HTML structure:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <title>Rubik's Cube Solver</title>
         <!-- Link to your CSS file -->
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
     </head>
     <body>
         <!-- Your content goes here -->
         <script src="script.js"></script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Styling with CSS:**
   - Open `style.css` and add styling rules to create the Rubik's Cube interface.
   - Refer to the provided CSS code for styling inspiration and adapt it to your project's needs.

4. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Open `script.js` and start writing JavaScript code to implement the Rubik's Cube functionality.
   - Begin by defining variables to represent the cube and its movements.
   - Implement functions to rotate the cube's layers and solve the cube.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test your project in a web browser to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Use browser developer tools to debug any issues and refine your code.

6. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Once you have a working Rubik's Cube solver, consider adding extra features such as a timer, move counter, or customizable themes.

7. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Document your code with clear comments to explain its purpose and functionality.
   - Create a README.md file to provide an overview of your project and instructions for users.
